Dear Team,

I would like to provide you with an update on the influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on corporate credit ratings. Please find below the key points:

ESG factors now play a crucial role in determining the creditworthiness of rated entities or issues. Notably, climate transition risk and physical risk factors are among the most significant factors impacting creditworthiness, given their substantial impact on the market.

ESG credit factors are industry-specific, meaning they vary from one industry to another. This recognition acknowledges the unique challenges and opportunities that each sector faces in relation to ESG considerations.

A comprehensive ESG scorecard has been established to evaluate an entity's performance on both quantitative and qualitative metrics. This scorecard allows for benchmarking against peers within the same industry, providing valuable insights into an entity's relative ESG performance.

For further information and a more detailed analysis, please refer to the attached document.

Best regards,
